which sorting to choose when multiple are given?
Total seems to be wrong on long list

In the long list format dates are in FINNISH, should be in ENGLISH

Columns between words should always be atleast one tab, now it's buggy

Get Extended atrributes in long format (like @ symbol)

Max pathname and max filename

CLOSE AND FREE EVERYTHING

LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_\!\@\#\$\%\^\&\*\(\)-+= < /dev/urandom | head -c 32 | xargs touch
